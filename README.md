# 10 simple rules to publish scientific software
Seems  very similar to - Ten Simple Rules for the Open Development of Scientific
Software (but we can write this as well).

Our objective is to write  - 

# Ten simple rules for "reviewing" scientific software/methodology . We wont focus on writing TEN, though. We will write as many as possible. Then redraft to merge what seems similar.

I think we should try to make this a community effort, and point this work out to specific people that have already blogged about the issue (references can be added in ref section) and invite them to contribute (agreed, but we'll be choosy in inviting select people).
